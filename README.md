** Wep Developer (Frontend / next.js) **

## ðŸ†ŽAbout me
Graduated from the faculty of ART philosophy department, I didn't find myself in this field when I was in college , last year in college, I learned Python just for fun and I found myself.
found my passion in programming, when you love something you're gonna be great at it, I love coding and I do love learning, so i decided to dive more into this field, took a lot of courses, and decided to be a Front-End web developer.

A well-represented and active team player able to work under pressure maintaining the high standards of the organization, Worked on some interesting front-end projects.

There's yet more to learn, yet more problems to solve, yet more to build.
So excited to learn more and be a better developer.
